# Walletigious
Disables MagSafe Wallet
Only works on iOS(>14.0) and A12+. For obvious reasons! ;)

Created as my first iOS tweak ever.

  Since about twelve years old I have always used tweaks to modify the way that my phone works to my personal prefrences. 
Usually I have always been able to install a package that matches what I am looking for. Until recently though I had not been able to find what I was
looking for.

This is what started me deciding to learn how to code and how to navigate Apples file system to modify what I want. On my terms.

Today I present Walletigious 0.0.1!
Used to disable the animation that comes when attatching a MagSafe wallet.

Future Updates, I hope to add more functionality, such as changing the color of the wallet animation and adding system prefrences option.
